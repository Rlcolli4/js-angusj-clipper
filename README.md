# js-angusj-clipper
#### *Polygon and line clipping and offsetting library for Javascript/Typescript*

*a port of Angus Johnson's clipper to WebAssembly/Asm.js*

Originally forkerd from xaviergonz, js-angusj-clipper if a powerful and useful tool. However, with changes made in Angular 6, some lines of code related to 'fs' and 'path' prevented us from being able to upgrade our project while using this fantastic plugin. This version removes the required lines that break the original script in Angular 6 allowing users to continue using clipper without restraint in angular applications. 

This project was forked using version 0.19.1 from xaviergonz/js-angusj-clipper.

### What is this?

A library to make polygon clipping (boolean operations) and offsetting **fast** on Javascript thanks
to WebAssembly with a fallback to Asm.js, based on the excellent Polygon Clipping (also known as Clipper) library by
Angus Johnson.

---

### Why?

Because sometimes performance does matter and I could not find a javascript library
as fast or as rock solid as the C++ version of [Clipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/).

As an example, the results of the benchmarks included on the test suite when running on my machine (node 9.10) are:

_Note, pureJs is [jsclipper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsclipper/), a pure JS port of the same library_
```
500 boolean operations over two circles of 5000 points each
  clipType: intersection, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (553ms)
    √ asmJs (1862ms)
    √ pureJs (1045ms)
  clipType: union, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (694ms)
    √ asmJs (2157ms)
    √ pureJs (1463ms)
  clipType: difference, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (659ms)
    √ asmJs (1878ms)
    √ pureJs (1383ms)
  clipType: xor, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (808ms)
    √ asmJs (2220ms)
    √ pureJs (1622ms)

10000 boolean operations over two circles of 100 points each
  clipType: intersection, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (449ms)
    √ asmJs (1080ms)
    √ pureJs (500ms)
  clipType: union, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (538ms)
    √ asmJs (1232ms)
    √ pureJs (495ms)
  clipType: difference, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (518ms)
    √ asmJs (1143ms)
    √ pureJs (456ms)
  clipType: xor, subjectFillType: evenOdd
    √ wasm (589ms)
    √ asmJs (1243ms)
    √ pureJs (500ms)

100 offset operations over a circle of 5000 points
  joinType: miter, endType: closedPolygon, delta: 5
    √ wasm (286ms)
    √ asmJs (1079ms)
    √ pureJs (1913ms)

5000 offset operations over a circle of 100 points
  joinType: miter, endType: closedPolygon, delta: 5
    √ wasm (227ms)
    √ asmJs (518ms)
    √ pureJs (796ms)
```

More or less, the results for **boolean operations** over moderately big polygons are:
* Pure JS port of the Clipper library: **~1.0s, baseline**
* This library (*WebAssembly*): **~0.5s**
* This library (*Asm.js*): **~1.5s** (mostly due to the emulation of 64-bit integer operations)

and for small polygons are:
* Pure JS port of the Clipper library: **~1.0s, baseline**
* This library (*WebAssembly*): **~1.1s** (due to the overhead of copying structures to/from JS/C++)
* This library (*Asm.js*): **~2.0s** (mostly due to the emulation of 64-bit integer operations + the overhead of copying structures to/from JS/C++)

As for **offsetting**, the results for a moderately big polygon are:
* Pure JS port of the Clipper library: **~1s, baseline**
* This library (*WebAssembly*): **~0.15s**
* This library (*Asm.js*): **~0.56s**

and for small polygons are:
* Pure JS port of the Clipper library: **~1s, baseline**
* This library (*WebAssembly*): **~0.28s**
* This library (*Asm.js*): **~0.65s**

### Getting started

```js
// import it with
import * as clipperLib from 'js-angusj-clipper'; // es6 / typescript
// or
const clipperLib = require('js-angusj-clipper'); // nodejs style require

async function mainAsync() {

  // create an instance of the library (usually only do this once in your app)
  const clipper = await clipperLib.loadNativeClipperLibInstanceAsync(
    // let it autodetect which one to use, but also available WasmOnly and AsmJsOnly
    clipperLib.NativeClipperLibRequestedFormat.WasmWithAsmJsFallback
  );

  // create some polygons (note that they MUST be integer coordinates)
  const poly1 = [
    {x: 0, y: 0},
    {x: 10, y: 0},
    {x: 10, y: 10},
    {x: 0, y: 10},
  ];

  const poly2 = [
    {x: 10, y: 0},
    {x: 20, y: 0},
    {x: 20, y: 10},
    {x: 10, y: 10},
  ];

  // get their union
  const polyResult = clipper.clipToPaths({
    clipType: clipperLib.ClipType.Union,

    subjectInputs: [
      { data: poly1, closed: true },
    ],

    clipInputs: [
      { data: poly2 }
    ],

    subjectFillType: clipperLib.PolyFillType.EvenOdd
  });

  /* polyResult will be:
  [
    [
      { x: 0, y: 0 },
      { x: 20, y: 0 },
      { x: 20, y: 10 },
      { x: 0, y: 10 }
    ]
  ]
 */
}

mainAsync();

```
